        "k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. At its core, kNN works by measuring the \"distance\" between data points. When you want to predict the category of a new data point, kNN looks at the 'k' closest points in your dataset (its \"neighbors\") and assigns the most common category among those neighbors to the new point.\n",

        "> **How does kNN measure distance?**\\\n",
        "kNN relies on distance metrics - commonly Euclidean distance (the straight-line distance between two points) - to find which data points are most similar. The algorithm compares all features (columns) in your dataset, so it's important that these features are numeric or converted to a format where distances can be calculated.\n",

        "> **How will we use kNN here?**\\\n",
        "In this notebook, we'll use kNN for classification: predicting whether a movie will receive a \"high\" or \"low\" score based on its features (like genre, country, budget, and more). By carefully cleaning and formatting our data, we ensure that kNN can measure distances and make meaningful predictions.\n",

We also need to scale these columns so that the values are in the same range, which ensures all features contribute equally rather than letting large-range variables dominate.\n",
        "- **Categorical columns** (like `country`, `top_genre`, and `top_lang`) should be converted into a format the model can use. One common way to do this is by creating dummy variables (also called one-hot encoding). For example, if you have a column called `top_genre` with values like \"Action\", \"Comedy\", or \"Drama\", you make a new column for each possible genre: one column for \"Action\", one for \"Comedy\", one for \"Drama\", and so on. In each new column, you put a `1` (or `True`) if the movie belongs to that genre, and a `0` (or `False`) if it does not. This allows for distances between values to be calculated.\n",

The train set provides patterns and relationships for the algorithm to 'learn', while the test set is kept separate to evaluate performance on new, unseen data. This process helps identify overfitting - when an algorithm fits the training data too closely and fails to generalize - and ensures that results reflect true predictive power. Comparing accuracy on both sets allows for a confident assessment of how well the approach will work in real-world scenarios.\n",
